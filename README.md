# project-3 - Investor's Dream

Added functionality: In a stock portfolio, users can adopt different algorithmic trading strategies for each stock, enabling a diversified combination of investment strategies, known as Fund of Funds (FOF) investment strategy, ultimately leading to superior investment returns for the stock portfolio. The combination employs the following algorithmic strategies:

## MACD strategy
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) strategy is an algorithmic trading strategy used in technical analysis to identify potential trends and momentum in financial instruments, particularly in stock trading. 

The main signals generated by the MACD strategy are:
1. Crossovers: When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it indicates a bullish signal, suggesting a potential buy signal.
2. Divergence: When the MACD line diverges from the price movement, it suggests a potential trend reversal or continuation.

## Trix strategy
The Trix (Triple Exponential Moving Average) strategy is based on the Triple Exponential Moving Average indicator, which is designed to filter out market noise and highlight significant price movements.

The main signals generated by the Trix strategy are:

1. Signal Line Crossovers: When the Trix line crosses above its Signal Line, it generates a bullish signal, suggesting a potential buy signal.
2. Signal Line Crossovers: When the Trix line crosses below its Signal Line, it generates a bearish signal, suggesting a potential sell signal.
3. Divergence: Similar to other oscillators, divergence between the Trix line and the price movement can indicate potential trend reversals.
   
## KDJ strategy
The KDJ strategy is a technical analysis tool used in financial markets to identify potential trend reversals and momentum in asset prices. It is based on the KDJ indicator, which is derived from the stochastic oscillator, a popular momentum indicator.

The KDJ strategy generates signals based on the following conditions:

1. Overbought and Oversold Conditions:
   
When the %K line crosses above 80, it indicates that the asset is overbought, suggesting a potential sell signal.
When the %K line crosses below 20, it indicates that the asset is oversold, suggesting a potential buy signal.

2. Divergence:

Similar to other oscillators, divergence between the KDJ lines and the price movement can indicate potential trend reversals.

3. Signal Line Crossovers:
   
When the %K line crosses above the %D line, it generates a bullish signal, suggesting a potential buy signal.
When the %K line crosses below the %D line, it generates a bearish signal, suggesting a potential sell signal.

## Case portfolio
As the case portfolio, we have a stock portfolio including TSLA, AAPL, and NVDA. We apply the MACD, Trix, and KDJ strategies to each stock, and we choose the backtest period from 2023.01.01 to 2023.07.25. After evaluating the portfolio, we obtained the following results:

1. Annualized Return: 56%
2. Cumulative Returns: 35%
3. Annual Volatility: 14%
4. Sharpe Ratio: 3.87
5. Sortino Ratio: 7.83

These evaluation metrics provide insights into the performance of the portfolio and the effectiveness of the applied trading strategies. The "Annualized Return" represents the average annual return of the portfolio during the backtest period. The "Cumulative Returns" show the total returns achieved over the entire period. The "Annual Volatility" indicates the risk or variability of the portfolio's returns. A higher Sharpe Ratio suggests better risk-adjusted performance, while a higher Sortino Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns with a focus on downside risk. By combining different strategies for each stock, we aim to achieve better investment returns and optimize the portfolio's overall performance.
