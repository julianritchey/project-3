- backtesting trading strategies;
- subscribing to trading strategy notifications;
- leveraging blockchain contracts for investment purposes.

# Project details

## Description and purpose

Investor's Dream v3.0 is a web application that provides users with two primary features:

1. The ability to design and develop custom trading stategies.
2. The ability to subscribe to notifications from custom or pre-existing trading strategies on a monthly or yearly basis.

In addition to providing the means to improve a user's invesment options, the application makes it easy for new investors to begin their investment journey. The application provides metrics to judge a trading strategy's performance. By leveraging Ethereum (blockchain) smart contracts, users can purchase Investor's Dream tokens and utilize them to subscribe to trading strategy notifications.

## Answers

### Investor's Dream token

![Investor's Dream token](miscellaneous/investors_dream_token.png)  
Blockchain provides us a unique opportunity to create a digital asset with which users can purchase our services. By creating and minting our own Investor's Dream token (`IDT`) on the Ethereum network, we provide users a value-added asset (with the potential to be traded on digital exchanges) they can use to subscribe to trading strategy notifications. Users can purchase our tokens directly through our site by exchanging their own Ether (`ETH`). Users can also transfer the token to and from other digital wallets.

### Trading strategies

![Trading strategy list](miscellaneous/trading_strategy_list.png)  
The trading strategy module offers users a selection of pre-existing and user-developed trading strategies, complete with performance metrics and the ability to backtest a strategy on an asset of the user's choosing. At present, the application offers users four algorithmic trading strategies:

- GRID
  - GRID trading strategy is a systematic trading approach that involves placing buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels in a grid-like pattern, aiming to profit from price fluctuations within a specific range. The GRID strategy offers users a tool for arbitrage trading based on following the stock price, aiming to achieve higher returns than simply buying and holding a stock while reducing volatility risk.
- KDJ
  - The KDJ strategy is a technical analysis tool used in financial markets to identify potential trend reversals and momentum in asset prices. It is based on the KDJ indicator, which is derived from the stochastic oscillator, a popular momentum indicator. The KDJ strategy generates signals based on the following conditions:
    - Overbought and Oversold Conditions\
      When the %K line crosses above 80, it indicates that the asset is overbought, suggesting a potential sell signal. When the %K line crosses below 20, it indicates that the asset is oversold, suggesting a potential buy signal.
    - Divergence\
      Similar to other oscillators, divergence between the KDJ lines and the price movement can indicate potential trend reversals.
    - Signal Line Crossovers\
      When the %K line crosses above the %D line, it generates a bullish signal, suggesting a potential buy signal. When the %K line crosses below the %D line, it generates a bearish signal, suggesting a potential sell signal.
- MACD
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) strategy is an algorithmic trading strategy used in technical analysis to identify potential trends and momentum in financial instruments, particularly in stock trading. The main signals generated by the MACD strategy are:
    - Crossovers\
      When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it indicates a bullish signal, suggesting a potential buy signal.
    - Divergence\
      When the MACD line diverges from the price movement, it suggests a potential trend reversal or continuation.
- TRIX
  - The Trix (Triple Exponential Moving Average) strategy is based on the Triple Exponential Moving Average indicator, which is designed to filter out market noise and highlight significant price movements. The main signals generated by the Trix strategy are:
    - Bullish Signal Line Crossovers\
      When the Trix line crosses above its Signal Line, it generates a bullish signal, suggesting a potential buy signal.
    - Bearish Signal Line Crossovers\
      When the Trix line crosses below its Signal Line, it generates a bearish signal, suggesting a potential sell signal.
    - Divergence\
      Similar to other oscillators, divergence between the Trix line and the price movement can indicate potential trend reversals.

Upon backtesting a strategy, the application outputs a variety of evaluation metrics, including

- signal evaluation
  - entry and exit signals relative to the daily closing price
- trade evaluation
  - the strategy's cumulative returns over a given period
- portfolio evaluation
  - annualized return
  - cumulative returns
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Sortino ratio
  - success ratio

The module describes and optimizes these trading strategies using the Python language, visualizes them through various charts, and generates buy and sell signals; all to provide users with a better understanding of each strategy's methodology and accuracy. Users are also provided backtesting functionality to assess the profitability and risk level of different asset-strategy combinations, enabling them to choose their preferred trading strategy for a particular asset.

### Social notifications

![Social notifications](miscellaneous/social_notifications.png)  
Python's adaptability and integration of libraries and APIs make it a powerful tool to streamline and enhance message delivery across various platforms, ensuring efficient and effective communication. At present, the application's notification module incorporates the following messaging platforms:

- Email\
  Email communication is automated using Python's email.message and smtplib libraries. Tailored messages are sent automatically to clients' inboxes, ensuring essential notifications and updates of trading signals reach their destination promptly.
- Telegram\
  Telegram seamlessly integrates with Python using the requests library. Custom bots deliver information and engage users, enhancing our communication strategy within the Telegram ecosystem.
- Discord\
  The Discord server interacts with Python via the discordwebhook library. The API provides automated notifications, content sharing, and community engagement through webhook-based messages to make our Discord communication dynamic.
- Facebook Messenger, SMS and WhatsApp\
  Twilio provides an API for Python to send messages and notifications via Facebook Messenger, SMS and WhatsApp. Python's flexibility, combined with Twilio's capabilities ensures our messages reach our clients on their preferred messaging platforms.
- Telegram Bot\
  Telegram bots are developed using Python's telegram.ext library. Intelligent bots respond to commands, offer information, and facilitate interactions, expanding the possibilities of engagement on Telegram.
